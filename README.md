# Description

Short little game I made for a week long 2024 Winter game jam! My friend and I wanted to host one for our University friends for the longest time, and we finally did one under the theme "giving"! This game was heavily inspired by a game called "Cat Academy" in Google Doodle's 2016 Halloween event. I adored the simple gameplay and cute art and wanted to try my own spin on it with a winter theme! In this game, you play as Santa Paws, and must dispel evil ghosts to turn them into presents. The more ghosts you dispel in a row increases your combo counter and score!

Everytime I make a game I have a specific goal in mind. Because this one was limited to the theme "giving" and we only had about a week to finish, I wanted to focus on learning art and animations! My amazing partner helped me out with procreate and taught me how to make sprites by hand. Although I used some external sprites, I'm pretty proud of the ones I managed to make myself!

# Want to add in the future:

- [ ] Add more custom shapes eg. V, star, lightning, etc.
- [ ] Add boss
- [ ] Add levels 2 and 3
- [ ] Update background, logo, and santa paws sprites w/ animations
